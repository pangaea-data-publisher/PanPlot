PanPlot2
============

The program PanPlot2 was developed as a visualization tool for the information system PANGAEA. It can be used as a stand-alone application or started automatically by the information system to plot data versus depth or time. The format of data the program PanPlot needs is a tabular saved in plain ASCII. The user can create this tabular with a spread sheet program like MS-Excel or with the information system. The default scales and graphic features can be modified by the user very easily.

PanPlot2 is in a beta status now!
