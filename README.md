PanPlot
=======

PanPlot allows the visualization of data versus time or space in standard x-y-plots. PanPlot can handle numerical, date/time, and text values, the input format is ASCII (text). Scales and graphic features can be modified and distinct parameters can be selected from the data matrix. Graphs graphs can be exported in several image formats (BMP, PNG, PDF, and SVG) which can be imported by graphic software for further processing. Data sets exported from PANGAEA can be plotted with PanPlot by drag'n drop.

PanPlot is distributed as freeware for the operating systems Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X and Linux.
